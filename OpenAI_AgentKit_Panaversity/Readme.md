## **Session 02: Agentic Organization (16/10/2025)**

Discussing Quiz from Repo **[Quiz.md](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai-from-low-code-to-code/blob/main/00_agentic_web/quiz.md)**

- OpenAI introduced two feature in Agent Kit, `Agent builder` and `ChatKit`
    * **Agent builder:** A set of building block to take AI agents from prototype to production. (no code agent)
    * **ChatKit:** A UI which display Agent as a conversational interface

- OpenAI is not yet profitable despite high revenue. They are currently focusing on dominance in market, they are running on investments.

### **Agentic Web:**
- There are 2 ways to access or used agentic web to reach and talk with consumers
    1) Within OpenAI/Chat GPT web, apps are availble to do some work like Spotify available within Chat GPT.
    2) A2A protocol (Agent to Agent) of Google, your engine is comminicating wih another agent of different organization. To implement this you need to be developer.

### **[The Rise of Agentic Organizations: How AI Is Redefining the Future of Work and Business](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai-from-low-code-to-code/blob/main/01_agentic_org/readme.md)**

- You will be able to transform whole company, by redefining work, ways of doing work and business.

- Sir is trying to teach us about business and how to get business from potential customers. We can tell business owners about different era is mankind history mentioned above.

#### **üè¢ Business Model**
* `Craft Era:` People made things by hand and sold directly (like a local baker or tailor).
* `Industrial Era:` Big factories made physical products like cars or soap and sold them through stores.
* `Digital Era:` Products became digital‚Äîlike apps, social media, and online shopping.
* `AI Era:` AI tools (like smart assistants) help deliver services that are personalized in real time. Work is powered by AI behind the scenes.

#### **üë©‚Äçüè≠ Operating Model (How Work Is Organized)**
* `Craft:` Small teams like a farmer and their workers.
* `Industrial:` Big hierarchies (lots of layers of bosses and workers doing repetitive jobs).
* `Digital:` Cross-functional teams (people from different departments work together using digital tools).
* `AI:` Flat teams where humans and AI "agents" (smart programs or robots) work side-by-side on tasks from start to finish.

#### **üèõÔ∏è Governance (How Decisions Are Made)**
* `Craft:` Local decisions, face-to-face.
* `Industrial:` Long-term planning, rigid rules.
* `Digital:` Agile planning‚Äîplans change quickly, and teams adjust as they go.
* `AI:` Decisions happen in real time with AI guidance, but humans stay accountable.

#### **üë• People and Culture**
* `Craft:` Artisans with deep hands-on skill.
* `Industrial:` Workers specialized in one job, following plans.
* `Digital:` **T-shaped** workers (they know one skill deeply, but also understand other areas and collaborate).
* `AI:` Mix of deep and broad skills (**M-shaped** workers), constant learning, and change embraced.

#### **üíª Technology and Data**
* `Craft:` Hand tools, handwritten notes.
* `Industrial:` Big machines and early computers (mainframes).
* `Digital:` PCs, mobile, internet, cloud storage.
* `AI:` Robots, sensors, drones, massive AI networks that learn from huge amounts of data.

#### **üåü Iconic Examples**
* `Craft:` Handmade bread, art, local goods.
* `Industrial:` Companies like Ford or Toyota.
* `Digital:` Google, Facebook, Spotify.
* `AI:` Still evolving‚Äîno single leader yet.

### **[The Agentic Organization: A Learning Guide to the Future of Business](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai-from-low-code-to-code/blob/main/01_agentic_org/agentic_org_guide.md#chapter-1-the-dawn-of-a-new-era)**

An agentic organization is one in which human workers and AI agents (virtual and physical) are designed to work together, sharing responsibilities, and executing tasks at scale.

#### **[Chapter 1: The Dawn of a New Era](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai-from-low-code-to-code/blob/main/01_agentic_org/agentic_org_guide.md#chapter-1-the-dawn-of-a-new-era)**

#### **[Chapter 2: The Building Blocks of an Agentic Organization](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai-from-low-code-to-code/blob/main/01_agentic_org/agentic_org_guide.md#chapter-2-the-building-blocks-of-an-agentic-organization)**

The McKinsey article that inspired this book identifies five `"pillars"` of the agentic organization: the **business model**, the **operating model, governance**, the **workforce, people, and culture**, and **technology and data**. Let's break down some of the key ideas within these pillars.

* **Empowered Edge:** In a traditional company, power is concentrated at the center. In an agentic organization, power is pushed to the "edge" ‚Äì to the people and teams who are closest to the customers and the market. This means that employees at all levels are trusted to make important decisions.

* **Decentralized Networks:** Instead of a rigid, top-down hierarchy, agentic organizations are often structured as a network of small, autonomous teams. These teams can be formed and reformed quickly to tackle different projects and challenges.

* **Nimble Resource Allocation:** In a fast-changing world, a company needs to be able to shift its resources (money, people, and time) to where they're needed most. Agentic organizations are great at this. They don't get bogged down in long-term, inflexible plans. They can quickly reallocate resources to new opportunities as they arise.

* **A Culture of Trust and Experimentation:** For an agentic organization to work, there has to be a high level of trust. Leaders have to trust their employees to make good decisions, and employees have to feel safe to take risks and try new things, even if they sometimes fail.

#### **[Chapter 3: AI: The Engine of the Agentic Organization](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai-from-low-code-to-code/blob/main/01_agentic_org/agentic_org_guide.md#chapter-3-ai-the-engine-of-the-agentic-organization)**

We've talked about how the agentic organization is a new way of working, but what's the technology that makes it all possible? The answer is Artificial Intelligence (AI).

For beginners, AI can be a confusing topic. You might think of robots from science fiction movies, but the reality is that AI is already all around us, from the recommendation engines on Netflix to the navigation apps on our phones.

In the context of the agentic organization, we're particularly interested in a type of AI called generative AI. This is the technology that allows computers to create new content, like text, images, and code. You've probably heard of tools like ChatGPT ‚Äì that's a great example of generative AI in action.

So, how does AI help to create an agentic organization? The `McKinsey article` suggests that AI can play three key roles:

* **Coach:** AI can act as a personal coach for every employee. It can provide them with the information they need to do their jobs, help them learn new skills, and even give them feedback on their performance. For example, a salesperson could use an AI coach to prepare for a meeting with a new client. The AI could provide information about the client's company, suggest talking points, and even simulate the conversation so the salesperson can practice.

* **Collaborator:** AI can also be a powerful collaborator. It can help teams brainstorm ideas, analyze data, and even write reports. This frees up people to focus on the more creative and strategic aspects of their work. For example, a marketing team could use a generative AI tool to come up with ideas for a new advertising campaign.

* **Catalyst:** Finally, AI can be a catalyst for change. It can help to break down the information silos that exist in traditional organizations. When everyone has access to the same information, it's easier for them to collaborate and make good decisions. AI can also automate many of the routine, repetitive tasks that take up so much of our time, freeing us up to focus on more important work.
