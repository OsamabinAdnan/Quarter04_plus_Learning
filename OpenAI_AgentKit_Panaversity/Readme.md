    * **ChatKit:** A UI which display Agent as a conversational interface

- OpenAI is not yet profitable despite high revenue. They are currently focusing on dominance in market, they are running on investments.

### **Agentic Web:**
- There are 2 ways to access or used agentic web to reach and talk with consumers
    1) Within OpenAI/Chat GPT web, apps are availble to do some work like Spotify available within Chat GPT.

- Sir is trying to teach us about business and how to get business from potential customers. We can tell business owners about different era is mankind history mentioned above.

#### **üè¢ Business Model**
* `Craft Era:` People made things by hand and sold directly (like a local baker or tailor).
* `Industrial Era:` Big factories made physical products like cars or soap and sold them through stores.
* `Digital Era:` Products became digital‚Äîlike apps, social media, and online shopping.
* `AI Era:` AI tools (like smart assistants) help deliver services that are personalized in real time. Work is powered by AI behind the scenes.

#### **üë©‚Äçüè≠ Operating Model (How Work Is Organized)**
* `Craft:` Small teams like a farmer and their workers.
* `Industrial:` Big hierarchies (lots of layers of bosses and workers doing repetitive jobs).
* `Digital:` Cross-functional teams (people from different departments work together using digital tools).
* `AI:` Flat teams where humans and AI "agents" (smart programs or robots) work side-by-side on tasks from start to finish.

#### **üèõÔ∏è Governance (How Decisions Are Made)**
* `Craft:` Local decisions, face-to-face.
* `Industrial:` Long-term planning, rigid rules.
* `Digital:` Agile planning‚Äîplans change quickly, and teams adjust as they go.
* `AI:` Decisions happen in real time with AI guidance, but humans stay accountable.

#### **üë• People and Culture**
* `Craft:` Artisans with deep hands-on skill.
* `Industrial:` Workers specialized in one job, following plans.
* `Digital:` "T-shaped" workers (they know one skill deeply, but also understand other areas and collaborate).
* `AI:` Mix of deep and broad skills ("M-shaped" workers), constant learning, and change embraced.
