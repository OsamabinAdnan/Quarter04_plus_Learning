## [How LLMs Work (The Basics)](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-low-code-agentic-ai/blob/main/00_prompt_engineering/readme.md#how-llms-work-the-basics)

Large Language Models are prediction engines that:
* Take text input (your prompt)
* Predict the next most likely word/token
* Continue this process to generate complete responses
* Base predictions on patterns learned from training data

## Key Concept: Autocompletion

LLMs don't "understand" in the human senseâ€”they're sophisticated autocomplete systems. Your prompt sets up the context for what should come next.
