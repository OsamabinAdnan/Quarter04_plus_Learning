## Prompt Driven Development (PDD) VS Vibe Coding

### Prompt-Driven Development (PDD)

* **You tell the AI exactly what you want. Very clear. Very specific.**
* Like giving your friend a recipe with step-by-step instructions.

*Example:*
* “Make a login page in Next.js with email + password fields, Tailwind styling, and form validation.”
* The AI follows your instructions exactly → precise output.

**In short:**
👉 *You drive the AI with clear prompts.*
👉 *More structure, less guessing.*

### Vibe Coding

* **You give the AI a rough idea, and it figures out the rest based on “vibes.”**
* Like saying to a friend: “Make it look cool and modern.”

*Example:*
* “Make a nice login page that feels clean.”
* The AI uses creativity → results vary.

**In short:**
👉 *Looser instructions, more freedom.*
👉 *Good for brainstorming or quick drafts.*

**Side-by-Side**
| Prompt-Driven Development (PDD) | Vibe Coding |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Clear, detailed instructions     | Loose, creative instructions |
| Predictable and consistent output | Surprising or varied output |
| Best for production-grade work   | Best for exploration and brainstorming |
| You control every step           | AI fills in the blanks |

## Video Generation Prompting

Repo Link **[Video Generation](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-low-code-agentic-ai/tree/main/00_prompt_engineering/video_generation)**

We can use it:
1) Flow
2) Gemini
3) Canvas etc.
4) VEO 3 is available with free credits

Google Veo 3 (like Runway ML, Pika Labs, or Stable Video Diffusion) responds to highly descriptive, cinematic prompts. The more structured, visual, and contextual your input, the closer the output matches your creative vision. Veo 3 delivers best-in-class quality, excelling in physics, realism, and prompt adherence, while also generating synchronized audio including sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue natively.

### Core Principles
1) Cinematic Specificity Over Generic Descriptions
2) Narrative Structure
3) Professional Film Language

### Anatomy of Effective Veo 3 Prompts
A well-structured prompt typically includes:

1) **Camera Movement/Angle** (establishing the shot)
2) **Subject Description** (who/what is in frame)
3) **Action/Movement** (what's happening)
4) **Environment/Setting** (where it takes place)
5) **Lighting/Atmosphere** (mood and visual tone)
6) **Audio Elements** (dialogue, sound effects, ambient)
7) **Technical Style** (film format, color grading)
8) **Duration Pacing** (how action unfolds over time)

### Examples
1) Example 1: Corporate Brand Video
2) Example 2: Cinematic Character Portrait
3) Example 3: Product Showcase
4) Example 4: Educational Content
5) Example 5: Lifestyle/Social Media Content
6) Example 6: Creative/Artistic Vision

### Best Practices for Prompt Engineering in Veo 3
1. Structure Your Narrative
2. Layer Your Audio Design
3. Control Camera Movement
4. Specify Visual Style
5. Plan for 8-Second Duration

### Advanced Techniques
1. Sequential Storytelling
2. Cinematic Camera Language
3. Professional Lighting Setups
4. Audio-Visual Synchronization

### Advanced Prompt Structure Template
[CAMERA MOVEMENT/ANGLE]: [Specific camera direction and framing] [SUBJECT]: [Detailed character/object description] [ACTION]: [What happens within 8 seconds] [ENVIRONMENT]: [Setting and atmospheric details] [LIGHTING]: [Type, direction, and mood of lighting] [AUDIO LAYERS]: - Dialogue: "[Exact spoken words]" - SFX: [Specific sound effects] - Ambient: [Environmental sounds] - Music: [Background music style] [VISUAL STYLE]: [Overall aesthetic and color treatment] [TECHNICAL]: [Camera specs and film format if relevant]
