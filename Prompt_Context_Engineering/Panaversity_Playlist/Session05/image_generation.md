### Best Practices for Prompt Engineering in Nano Banana
1. **Anchor the Subject**
    * Always mention: “of the uploaded photo” to retain likeness.
2. **Control the Scene**
    * Use environment cues: background, wall, lighting, props.
3. **Specify Style & Mood**
    * Example moods: cinematic, corporate, fine art, futuristic.
4. **Borrow from Photography**
    * Camera/lens terms like 85mm f/1.4 create realism.
    * Lighting terms like Rembrandt, softbox, backlight help shape mood.
5. **Add Branding Elements**
    * Vector logos, text overlays, geometric accents.
6. **Iterate in Layers**
    * Start broad (“corporate portrait”), then refine with poses, props, typography.
