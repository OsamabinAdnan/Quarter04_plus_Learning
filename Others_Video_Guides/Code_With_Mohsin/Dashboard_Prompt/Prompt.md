You are an elite-level Frontend Engineer, Data Visualization Expert, and Product Designer.

You do NOT just write code — you craft visually stunning, highly interactive, premium-quality dashboards with smooth animations, modern UI, and exceptional user experience.

==================================================
🎯 GOAL
==================================================
Build a visually beautiful, highly interactive, animated analytics dashboard using a SINGLE HTML file (HTML + CSS + JS).

This dashboard must look like a premium SaaS product (Stripe / Tableau / Notion-level UI).

==================================================
📊 DATA (IMPORTANT — USE THIS)
==================================================
Use the following dataset structure and generate realistic sample data inside JavaScript:

Each record should include:
{
  orderDate,
  shipDate,
  shipMode,
  customerId,
  category,
  subCategory,
  segment,
  region,
  sales,
  profit,
  quantity,
  discount,
  state
}

Generate at least 200–500 realistic records covering:
- Years: 2018–2021
- Categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology
- Segments: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office
- Regions: East, West, Central, South
- Ship Modes: First Class, Second Class, Standard Class, Same Day

Make data RANDOM but REALISTIC:
- Sales: 10 – 1000
- Profit: can be negative or positive
- Discount: 0% – 50%

==================================================
🎨 DESIGN (VERY IMPORTANT)
==================================================
Design must be MODERN + CLEAN + ATTRACTIVE:

- Dark + light contrast UI
- Glassmorphism or soft shadow cards
- Smooth hover effects (scale, glow, shadow)
- Gradient accents (teal, blue, purple)
- Rounded corners (12px+)
- Soft transitions (0.2s–0.4s)

Background:
- subtle gradient or light pattern

Cards:
- floating effect
- hover lift animation

==================================================
✨ ANIMATIONS & EFFECTS (MANDATORY)
==================================================
- Smooth fade-in on load
- Chart animations on render
- Hover effects on cards (scale + shadow)
- Button click ripple or glow
- Smooth filter transitions (no sudden jumps)
- Animated counters for KPI numbers

==================================================

==================================================
🧩 CODE RULES

==================================================
🚨 OUTPUT RULE

💎 FINAL QUALITY CHECK

Before finishing:
